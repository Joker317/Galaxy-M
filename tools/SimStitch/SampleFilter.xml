  <help>
Sample Filter compares spectra within their class groupings (or across all classes if no 'classname' is provided) and removes peaks from the data matrix where those peaks are not observed within a sufficient percentage within any class (or across all classes). 

Users should be wary of setting moderate to high thresholds where there are small numbers of samples within any group. In such cases, even moderate percentages (e.g. 60) can become 'high' (e.g. from 60, becoming 70 or 80) due to rounding up. This can result in a lot of excluded peaks.
