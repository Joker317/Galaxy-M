  <help>
	This function simply creates a file to store the 'set number' and 'number of replicates' that are used repeatedly by SimStitch and do not change within a single study. In the future, both these variables will be replaced by passing an excel file (or similar) that stores all relevant variables for a study i.e. replacing the current FileList 'set'. At that time, a variable number of replicates will be allowed for each sample with SimStitch calculating the appropriate number on an ad hoc basis for each sample, using the metainformation in the excel file.
