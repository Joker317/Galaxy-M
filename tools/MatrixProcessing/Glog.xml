	<help>
	This function applies a g-log (Generalised Logarithm) transformation to data held within a PLS Toolbox (Eigenvector Research) dataset object. It is intended to be used with the output from the SimStitch pipeline.

	The algorithm initially optimises a 'lambda' parameter based on samples that are highlighted as 'included' in your dataset object. These samples ought to be the Quality Control (QC) samples from your experiment. By optimising the lambda parameter to the QC samples, the g-log transform is able to reduce the technical variation in your data without suppressing the biological variation. 

	This version of the algorithm also scales the data by a linear and a power factor to enable the optimisation algorithm to run on datasets with low signal and variation e.g. FT-ICR lipid spectra from very small biological volumes.
